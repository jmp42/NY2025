To wish everyone a happy new year, nothing better than a small Gamebuino application with sound and lights!

How to make music easily with a Gamebuino META? gb.sound.tone() is made for that. 
Indicate the frequency of the note and its duration, and there you go.
play_chord_freq() in this app allows to obtain a richer tone from a single note by playing harmonics.
